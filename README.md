# Description
Compute some of the parameters for a Cassegrain Telescope

This program is heavily scripted to implement multiple non linear
equations and solve them, all than in very friendly UI.  

It was reduced multiple times, which will make the coding process harder to understand, which why, for the future me to understand the present me, I had to actually comment this.  

Please refer to the pdf of the scanned papers of the calculations and the algorithm implemented here, especially the smart m index, which turned out to be at great help to reduce the loops.  


# Changelog
ERRORS TO LOOK FOR  
the sqrt() being undefined because of the negative value inside line 161 and line 173 and line 188
